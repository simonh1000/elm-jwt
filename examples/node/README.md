# Elm 0.19 with Webpack 4, Hot Reloading & Babel 7

Elm dev environment with hot-loading (i.e. state is retained as you edit your code - Hot Module Reloading, HMR)). I use this daily for my professional work. Like elm-community/elm-webpack-starter but using Webpack 4.

## Installation

Clone this repo into a new project folder and run install script.
(You will probably want to delete the .git/ directory and start version control afresh.)

With npm

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:simonh1000/elm-webpack-starter.git new-project
$ cd new-project
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
